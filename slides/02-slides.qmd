## Look back

* Great use of **Slack**
* Big data definition
* Set up `ssh` keypair and GitHub token
* Used the shell in Linux on a virtual machine through Codespaces

## Agenda and Goals for Today

* Quick tour of the cloud services that are used in the course
* Extended Lab: 
  * Setting up Azure and AWS accounts
  * Starting VMs in the cloud and connecting to them

tribble( ~"Term", ~"Definition",
         "Local", "Your current workstation (laptop, desktop, etc.), wherever you start the terminal/console application.",
         "Remote", "Any machine you connect to via ssh or other means."

## Working on a single machine

You are most likely using traditional data analysis tools, which are **single threaded** and run on **a single machine**.

## The **BIG DATA** problem

## Is Moore's Law Dead?

## New Hardware 

### Need

* The demand for data processing will not be met by relying on the same technology. 
* The key to modern data processing is **new semiconductors**
  * Not just squeezing more transistors per area
  * Need new compute architectures that are built and optimized for specialized functions
* Specialized edge hardware for Edge Computing
* While many declare Moore’s Law to be broken or no longer valid, in reality it’s not the law that is broken but rather a heat problem.

### What

* Graphic Processing Units (GPUs)

* Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)

* Data Processing Units (DPUs)

* Photonic computing

## So, we can't store or process data on a single machine, what do we do?

## We distribute

More CPUs, more memory, more storage!

# How do we do that?


## Simple, we use the **cloud**

<img src="img/cloud-providers.png" width=800>

## Cloud computing is a big deal!

### Benefits

* Provides access to low-cost computing

* Costs are decreasing every year

* Elastic

* PAAS works!

* Many other benefits...
