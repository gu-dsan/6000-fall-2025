## Course Description

Data is everywhere! Many times, it's just too big to work with traditional tools. This is a hands-on, practical workshop style course about using cloud computing resources to do analysis and manipulation of datasets that are too large to fit on a single machine and/or analyzed with traditional tools. The course will focus on Spark, MapReduce, the Hadoop Ecosystem and other tools.

You will understand how to acquire and/or ingest the data, and then massage, clean, transform, analyze, and model it within the context of big data analytics. You will be able to think more programmatically and logically about your big data needs, tools and issues.

### 

Always refer to the [syllabus](/syllabus.html) and [calendar](/schedule.html) in the [course website]({{< var course.url >}}) for class policies.

# BIG DATA

## Where does it come from?<br/>How is it being created?


## In one minute of time (2018)

## In one minute of time (2021)

<img src="img/data-never-sleeps-2021.png" width=500>

## _A lot_ of it is hapenning online.


**We can record every:**
* click
* ad impression
* billing event
* video interaction
* server request
* transaction
* network message
* fault
* ...

<img src="img/iceberg.jpg">

## It can also be user-generated content, e.g.:

* Instagram posts
* Tweets
* Videos
* Yelp reviews
* Facebook posts
* Stack Overflow posts
* ...

<img src="img/people.jpg">

## But health and scientific computing create a lot too!
<img src="img/scientific.png">

???

## There's lots of **graph** data too

Many interesting datasets have a graph structure:

* Social networks
* Google's knowledge graph
* Telecom networks
* Computer networks
* Road networks
* Collaboration/relationships

Some of these are **HUGE**

## System log files

<img src="img/syslog-file.jpg" width=600>

## Internet of Things (IoT)

Sensors everywhere...

<img src="img/sensors-everywhere.jpg" width=600>

## Smartphones collecting our information

<img src="img/smartphone.jpg">

## Where else?

* The Internet

* Transactions


* Databases


* Excel

* PDF Files


* Anything digital (music, movies, apps)


* Some old floppy disk lying around the house


## Typical real world scenario

You have a laptop with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB Solid State drive. You are given a 1TB dataset in text files, where every file is slightly different. **Oh no, what do you do?**

AD: This was the situation I experienced during my AstraZeneca interview. We had to do 
a data analysis for our interview, and the data given was the FDA drug adverse event reporting database. 

# What is Big Data?

## Let's discuss!


## Big Data Definitions

### Wikipedia

_"In essence, is a term for a collection of datasets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using traditional tools and applications. Big Data technologies describe a new generation of technologies and architectures designed to economically extract value from very large volumes of a wide variety of data, by enabling high-velocity capture, discover and/or analysis"_


### O'Reilly

_"Big data is when the size of the data itself becomes part of the problem"_


### EMC/IDC

_"Big data technologies describe a new generation of technologies and architectures, designed to economically extract value from very large volumes of a wide variety of data, by enabling high-velocity capture, discovery, and/or analysis."_


## Frameworks for thinking about Big Data

### IBM:  (The famous 3-V’s definition)

* Volume (Gigabytes -> Exabytes)

* Velocity (Batch -> Streaming Data)

* Variety (Structured, Semi-structured, & Unstructured)


### Additional V's

* Variability
* Veracity
* Visualization
* Value


## Think of data size as a function of processing and storage

* Can you analyze/process your data on a single machine?


* Can you store (or is it stored) on a single machine?


If any of of the answers is _**no**_ then you have a big-ish data problem!

# Thinking about big data workflows

[William Cohen](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wcohen/) (Director, Research Engineering, Google) said the following:


Working with big data is _not_ about:

* Code optimization
* Learning the details of today's hardware/software (they are evolving...)

Working with big data _is_ about **understanding**:

* The cost of what you want to do
* What the tools that are available offer
* How much can be accomplished with linear or nearly-linear operations 
* How to organize your computations so that they effectively use whatever’s fast
* How to test/debug/verify with large data


## Traditional data analysis tools like `R` and `Python` are single threaded


# Data Engineering

## Difference between Data Scientist and Data Engineer

In this course, you'll be doing *a little* data engineering!

<img src="img/rogati.png" width=600>
</div>


## As an analyst/data scientist, you _really_ need both

<img src="img/data-engineering-ability.png" width=600>
</div>

???

Depending on where you end up


## Working on a single machine

You are most likely using traditional data analysis tools, which are **single threaded** and run on **a single machine**.

## The **BIG DATA** problem

<img src="img/moores.png">

## Is Moore's Law Dead?

---

## New Hardware 

### Need

* The demand for data processing will not be met by relying on the same technology. 
* The key to modern data processing is **new semiconductors**
  * Not just squeezing more transistors per area
  * Need new compute architectures that are built and optimized for specialized functions
* Specialized edge hardware for Edge Computing
* While many declare Moore’s Law to be broken or no longer valid, in reality it’s not the law that is broken but rather a heat problem.

### What

* Graphic Processing Units (GPUs)

* Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)

* Data Processing Units (DPUs)

* Photonic computing

## So, we can't store or process data on a single machine, what do we do?

<img src="img/medium-6.png" width=800>


## We distribute

More CPUs, more memory, more storage!

<img src="img/distribute-the-data.png" width=600>

# How do we do that?


## Simple, we use the **cloud**

<img src="img/cloud-providers.png" width=800>

## Cloud computing is a big deal!

### Benefits

* Provides access to low-cost computing

* Costs are decreasing every year

* Elastic

* PAAS works!

* Many other benefits...

# Linux Command Line


## Linux Command Line

### Terminal 

![](img/terminal_old_computer.jpg)

- Terminal access was **THE ONLY** way to do programming
- No GUIs! No Spyder, Jupyter, RStudio, etc.
- Coding is still more powerful than graphical interfaces for complex jobs
- Coding makes work repeatable

## Linux Command Line

### BASH

![](img/bash.png)

- Created in 1989 by Brian Fox
- Brian Fox also built the first online interactive banking software
- BASH is a command processor
- Connection between you and the machine language and hardware

## Linux Command Line

### The Prompt

username@hostname:current_directory $

What do we learn from the prompt?

- Who you are - **username**
- The machine where your code is running - **hostname**
- The directory where your code is running - **current_directory**
- The shell type - **$** - this symbol means BASH


## Linux Command Line

### Syntax

**`COMMAND -F --FLAG`**
* COMMAND is the program
* Everything after that are arguments
* F is a single letter flag
* FLAG is a single word or words connected by dashes flag. A space breaks things into a new argument.
  + Sometimes single letter and long form flags (e.g. F and FLAG) can refer to the same argument

**`COMMAND -F --FILE file1`**

Here we pass an text argument "file1" into the FILE flag

The **`-h`** flag is usually to get help. You can also run the **`man`** command and pass the name of the program as the argument to get the help page.

Let's try basic commands:

- **`date`** to get the current date
- **`whoami`** to get your user name
- **`echo "Hello World"`** to print to the console


## Linux Command Line

### Examining Files

Find out your **P**resent **W**orking **D**irectory **`pwd`**

Examine the contents of files and folders using the **`ls`** command

Make new files from scratch using the **`touch`** command

Globbing - how to select files in a general way

- **`\*`** for wild card any number of characters
- **`\?`** for wild card for a single character
- **`[]`** for one of many character options
- **`!`** for exclusion
- special options **`[:alpha:]`**, **`[:alnum:]`**, **`[:digit:]`**, **`[:lower:]`**, **`[:upper:]`**

[Reference material](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-globbing-linux/)
[Reference material: Shell Lesson 1,2,4,5](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell)

---

## Linux Command Line

### Navigating Directories

Knowing where your terminal is executing code ensures you are working with the right inputs and making the right outputs.

Use the command `pwd` to determine the Present Working Directory.

Let's say you need to change to a folder called "git-repo". To change directories you can use a command like `cd git-repo`.


- **`.`** refers to the current directory, such as **`./git-repo`**
- **`..`** can be used to move up one folder, use **`cd ..`**, and can be combined to move up multiple levels **`../../my_folder`**
- **`/`** is the root of the Linux OS, where there are core folders, such as system, users, etc.
- **`~`** is the home directory. Move to folders referenced relative to this path by including it at the start of your path, for example **`~/projects`**.

To view the structure of directories from your present working directory, use the **`tree`** command

[Reference link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/linux-command-line-bash-tutorial/)

## Linux Command Line

### Interacting with Files

Now that we know how to navigate through directories, we need to learn the commands for interacting with files

- **`mv`** to move files from one location to another
  + Can use file globbing here - ?, *, [], ...
- **`cp`** to copy files instead of moving
  + Can use file globbing here - ?, *, [], ...
- **`mkdir`** to make a directory
- **`rm`** to remove files
- **`rmdir`** to remove directories
- **`rm -rf`** to blast everything! WARNING!!! DO NOT USE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
---

## Linux Command Line

### Using BASH for Data Exploration

Commands:

- **`head FILENAME`** / **`tail FILENAME`** - glimpsing the first / last few rows of data
- **`more FILENAME`** / **`less FILENAME`** - viewing the data with basic up / (up & down) controls
- **`cat FILENAME`** - print entire file contents into terminal
- **`vim FILENAME`** - open (or edit!) the file in vim editor
- **`grep FILENAME`** - search for lines within a file that match a regex expression
- **`wc FILENAME`** - count the number of lines (**`-l`** flag) or number of words (**`-w`** flag)


[Reference link](https://elucidata.io/bash-the-data-scientists-magnifying-glass/)
[Reference material: Text Lesson 8,9,15,16](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/stdout-standard-out-redirect)

## Linux Command Line

### Pipes and Arrows

* **`|`** sends the stdout to another command (is the most powerful symbol in BASH!)
* **`>`**  sends stdout to a file and overwrites anything that was there before
* **`>>`** appends the stdout to the end of a file (or starts a new file from scratch if one does not exist yet)
* **`<`** sends stdin into the command on the left

To-dos:

* `echo Hello World`
* Counting rows of data with certain attributes

[Reference material: Text Lesson 1,2,3,4,5](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/stdout-standard-out-redirect)


## Linux Command Line

### Alias and User Files

.bashrc is where your shell settings are located

If we wanted a shortcut to find out the number of our running processes, we would write a commmand like **`whoami | xargs ps -u | wc -l`**.

We don't want to write out this full command every time! Let's make an alias.

**`alias alias_name="command_to_run"`**

**`alias nproc="whoami | xargs ps -u | wc -l"`**

Now we need to put this alias into the .bashrc

**`alias nproc="whoami | xargs ps -u | wc -l" >> ~/.bashrc`**

What happened??


**`echo alias nproc="whoami | xargs ps -u | wc -l" >> ~/.bashrc`**

Your commands get saved in **`~/.bash_history`**

## Linux Command Line

### Process Managment

Use the command **`ps`** to see your running processes.

Use the command **`top`** or even better **`htop`** to see all the running processes on the machine.

Install the program **htop** using the command **`sudo yum install htop -y`**


Find the process ID (PID) so you can kill a broken process.

Use the command **`kill [PID NUM]`** to signal the process to terminate. If things get really bad, then use the command **`kill -9 [PID NUM]`**

To kill a command in the terminal window it is running in, try using **Ctrl + C** or **Ctrl + /**

Run the **`cat`** command on its own to let it stay open. Now open a new terminal to examine the processes and find the cat process.
