# Cloud9 Setup

Follow these instructions _step-by-step_ to setup your Cloud9 in AWS. The screenshots may look a bit different than what you are seeing, but the flow is the same.

## Creating Cloud9 Environment

1. Search for `cloud9` in the search bar of your AWS console as shown in the figure below.

4. There are a few options here. You have to make a few changes.
    - The **Instance type** section is to select how large an instance for Cloud9. **Select the `t3.small` instance type**
    - The **Platform** section is for selecting the operating system for your new instance. **Leave as the default**
    - The **Timeout** option is set so your instance will hibernate after 30 minutes so you are not charged for the instance 24/7. This is a major problem for cloud services because you can run up a bill quite quickly! **Leave as the default**
    - In Network Settings, **Connection** is how to connect to your instance. **Select `Secure Shell (SSH)`**
    - Finally, click the orange button `Create`

5. You will be sent to the environments page of the Cloud9 service. Your environment is now building. In the table below, for your environment (the row), click on the `Open` button in Cloud9 IDE column. In the screenshot, we named it `cloud9-env`.
