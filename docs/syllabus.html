<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
<p>Data is everywhere! Many times, the data is just too big to analyze with traditional programming libraries on your laptop. That is where cloud providers and distributed computation save the day. This is a hands-on, practical workshop-style course about using cloud computing resources to do analysis and manipulation of big data datasets that are too large to fit on a single machine and/or analyzed with traditional tools. The course will focus on techniques (such as Concurrency) and tools (such as Apache Spark) for working with Big Data.</p>
<p>You will understand how to ingest the data, and then massage, clean, transform, analyze, and model it within the context of big data analytics. You will be able to think more programmatically and logically about your big data needs, tools, and issues.</p>
</section>

<li>Develop strategies to break down large problems and datasets into manageable pieces</li>
<li>Identify broad spectrum resources and documentation to remain current with big data tools and developments</li>
<li>Communicate and interpret the big data analytics results through written and verbal methods</li>

<p>This is a hands-on, practical, workshop style course that provides opportunities to use the tools and techniques discussed in class. Although this is not a programming course per se, there is programming involved.</p>
<section id="lectures-and-labs" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lectures-and-labs">Lectures and Labs</h3>
<p>This course is split into a lecture/lab format, where every class session will have a lecture portion, and most sessions will have an in-class lab portion:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the lecture, we will discuss the concepts and techniques as well as the history and development of these big data tools and cloud platforms.</li>
<li>During the lab sessions, you will be completing exercises and following examples which are designed to show you how to implement the ideas and concepts with various tools. We will start the labs in class but we will not finish. It is your responsibility to complete the labs (<strong>which is part of the grade</strong>) and will enable your learning.</li>

</section>
<section id="lab-deliverables" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lab-deliverables">Lab Deliverables</h3>
<p>Each lab will have a deliverable. It is essential that you learn the skills presented in the labs so that you can effectively complete the assignments and the big data project. The lab deliverables can sometimes be completed during lab, however, it is your responsibility to complete the deliverable as part of your work outside of lecture/lab time.</p>
</section>
<section id="homework-assignments" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="homework-assignments">Homework Assignments</h3>
<p>You will be several homework assignments for roughly half of the semester. The goal of these problem sets is to hone your big data skills by answering some questions about large datasets. The problem sets will build on the labs and will be much more in-depth. Deliverables from the assignment will usually include code written for your programs and the output produced.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="big-data-analytics-project">Big Data Analytics Project</h3>
<p>Students will assemble into groups of no more than 4 students. You will perform and write up an analysis of a <em>big</em> dataset using the tools learned in class. <em>Big</em> is defined as “a dataset that is so large that you cannot work with it on a laptop.”</p>
<p>You will each conduct big data project using Reddit textual data. This project will encompass all of the skills you will learn throughout the semester including data ingestion, transformation, analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning. Similar to previous core courses, the big data project will be a product you can share with the world to demonstrate your data science expertise. Intermediate project assignments will help you incrementally build towards your final portfolio. There will be assignments on exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing. Each successive assignment and the final submissions will incorporate feedback from your peers, TAs, and professors. The final timelines and deliverables for the project will be announced in class.</p>

<p>Plagiarism or academic dishonesty in any form will not be tolerated and may result in a failing grade. All Honor Code violations will be submitted to the Honor Council.</p>
<p>Academic integrity is central to the learning and teaching process. Students are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that will contribute to the maintenance of academic integrity by making all reasonable efforts to prevent the occurrence of academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty includes (but is not limited to) obtaining or giving aid on an examination, having unauthorized prior knowledge of an examination, doing work for another student, and plagiarism of all types, including copying code.</p>
<p>Plagiarism is the intentional or unintentional presentation of another person’s idea or product as one’s own. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to the following: copying verbatim all or part of another’s written work; using phrases, charts, figures, illustrations, code, or mathematical/scientific solutions without citing the source; paraphrasing ideas, conclusions, or research without citing the source; and using all or part of a literary plot, poem, film, musical score, or other artistic product without attributing the work to its creator. Students can avoid unintentional plagiarism by following carefully accepted scholarly practices. Notes taken for papers and research projects should accurately record sources cited, quoted, paraphrased, or summarized sources and articles should be acknowledged in footnotes.</p>

Suppose you disclose an incident of sexual misconduct to a professor in or outside of the classroom (except disclosures in papers). In that case, that faculty member must report the incident to the Title IX Coordinator or Deputy Title IX Coordinator. The coordinator will, in turn, reach out to the student to provide support, resources, and the option to meet—[Please note that the student is not required to meet with the Title IX coordinator.]. More information about reporting options and resources can be found on the <a href="https://sexualassault.georgetown.edu/resourcecenter">Sexual Misconduct Website.</a></p>
<p>If you would prefer to speak to someone confidentially, Georgetown has a number of fully confidential professional resources that can provide support and assistance. These resources include:</p>
