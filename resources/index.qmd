Here are a bunch of resources that will help you in this class. ***This is a tough and challenging class***, but if you ***put in the hard yards*** you will learn a lot. ***I promise you, that you will find me willing to work with you every step of the way***.

1. _Due dates are closer than they appear_.

## Pay Attention

Due dates are closer than they appear. Working with Big Data is tricky, start homeworks early to account for the ***unknown unknowns*** that will inevitably show up.

2. Follow instructions for in the homeworks and lab assignments. The homeworks and labs require the output generated by your code to be in a specific format (JSON usually), in a specifically named file with specifically named fields. Your homeworks are graded by an autograder program (so I wrote code to grade the output of your code) and the autograder expects to see the output in a certain prescribed way and if it does not find that then it deducts points. I do manually review all grades once the autograder has done its job. This is important not only for this class but probably more so going forward when the output your code produces will be consumed by both humans and machines.
